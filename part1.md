## Side Channel Attack
### Power Analysis Attack (Power Cryptanalysis Attack)
- Attack allows to retrieve a secret
- Trace power consumption of device
- Trace: Measurement of consumption during a single execution
	- Depends on the secret and input
- Simple Power Analysis (SPA) uses a single trace
- Differential Power Analysis (DPA):
	- Statistical analysis of multiple traces
	- similar to timing cryptanalysis
	- Assumption: power consumption depends not only on instruction but also the value of the operands
		- storing 1 vs. 0 in a register/memory
		- shifts and rotations depend on number of positions
		- logical and arithmetic
	- ... TODO ...
- High-Order Differential Power Analysis uses complex statistical methods, again multiple traces
- Primary Targets: Smartcards, RFID chips, Sensor nodes, etc. Basically embedded devices
- Physical access to device needed

#### Technical Details
- Power describes the consumed energy per unit time
- Dynamic power consumption
	- Power to charge transistor gate
	- State changes
	- Discharge (e.g. from 1 to 0) is free => if state changes  \\(f \\) times only  \\(\frac{f}{2} \\) times a charge happens which adds up to the dynamic power consumption.
- Static power consumption
	- Power consumed while no states changes happen (i.e. no gates need charging)
- CMOS gates
	-  \\(0 \to 0, 1 \to 1 \\) nearly no power needed
	-  \\(0 \to 1, 1 \to 0 \\) high power consumption
- While measuring use average to reduce noise

#### Practice
- Create trace containing instructions depending on the key
- Interesting instruction sets
	- rounds in DES
	- square vs. multiply in RSA exponentiation (see exercise)
	- hamming weights of words

#### SPA on RSA (Exercise)
- Attack on top-down square and multiply exponentiation
	- done during signing and decryption
- Observation
	- Squaring followed by squaring  \\(\Rightarrow \\) bit of the exponent is zero
	- Squaring followed by multiplication  \\(\Rightarrow \\) bit of the exponent is one
- On slides: Square has higher power consumption than multiplication
- In Exercise: ... TODO ...

#### Protections
- Desynchronization: change power consumption randomly
	- e.g. insert dummy instructions
	- Dummy instructions can be recognised by SPA
- Noise generator: piece of hardware to randomise consumption
	- Using larger set of traces can counter this. Noise can be filtered out.
- Filter at power input & physical shielding
	- In case of physical access, can be removed/deactivated
- Software balancing
	- Results in significant overhead to the computation (not very practical)
- Hardware balancing
	- Processor needs the same amount of power for all instructions, operand's values
	- Costly and hard to design
- TODO: Shamir's countermeasure

### Side Channel Attack: Cache-timing Attack on AES
- Differential attack
- ... TODO ... read paper
- Can recover the secret key by measuring the time
- Attacker sends specific plaintext (known-plaintext attack) to server and receives the ciphertext. Measures the time the server needs.
- Attack possible due to AES Design: Very hard to write constant time high performance AES software for general-purpose computers.
- Vulnerability exists because implementations *use lookup tables* for internal operations, such as S-Boxes.
	- Time to access a specific table depends on the address of the position
	- Data will be in cache or in memory, different access times
		- L1 and L2 caches, RAM, Disk
	- Attack can learn about the address being accessed by looking at the time needed for access
- In AES table lookup, i.e. memory addresses, are derived from the secret key and plaintext
- ... TODO ... after reading paper slides 41ff
- Lessons learned
	- General: write constant time security software
	- Cache-timing attacks countermeasures:
		- avoid memory access
		- alternative lookup tables
		- data-oblivious memory access patterns
		- application specific masking
		- static or disabled caches
		- dynamic table storage
		- hiding the timing
	- Most countermeasures are expensive in regard to money (e.g. redesign cipher, redesign hardware) or in regard to performance

## TEMPEST: Transmitted Elector-Magnetic Pulse / Energy Standards & Testing
- Compromise emanation generated by electrical equipment
- May be sensed and transmitted over air, water, electrical lines, etc.
- Examples of such electrical equipment: Display, Keyboard, Cable, Processor

### Computer Screen
#### Attack 1: Cable Emissions
- Emissions by cables connecting a computer to the computer's display
- Impulses in the wiring generates emissions
- Emissions can be recoded by a receiver and processed
- Screen content can be easily read

#### Attack 2: Reflections
- Use telescope to see reflections and read what is on the screen
- Many surfaces work: Spoon, Eye, Glasses, Tea pots, etc.

### Keyboard
- Wired and wireless keyboards vulnerable

## Tamper Resilience
- Tamper Resistant: Bank vault approach; make sure no one can break-in
- Tamper Responding: Burglar alarm approach; real-time detection of intrusion and prevention of access to sensitive data
- Tamper Evident: Evidence of break-in is left by the break-in; design system in a way that a break-in leaves evidence

### Smart Cards
- Basic Properties
	- hold secret keys
	- can perform crypto operations
	- access protection using PIN
	- limited tamper resistance
- Possible to do invasive attack
	- remove everything around the smart card chip (depackaging chip)
	- read out content of memory by initiating the usual protocol, read data on bus and record it
- Memory Read-Out Protection
	- authentication that card talks to a trusted entity before reading/using secret stored on card
	- Use of multiple algorithm and key variations. Switching between them every few weeks using a signed message send to the card. Attacker can't read out secret before card switches to it
	- Still possible to counter these protections
- Invasive Attack Protections:
	- Use a sensor mesh in the top metal layer, if broken or shortened card destroys itself
	- Hide lower layer's structure by chemical and mechanical polishing
	- These protections can be circumvented
		- Focused Ion Beam (FIB): Possible to drill small holes to attach equipment to circuit lines the attacker is interested in, without breaking any possible sensor meshes
- Glitch Attack
	- Replace critical machine instruction with an other one
	- Also possible to corrupt data values while in transfer
	- Possible ways to introduce a glitch:
		- clock signal (e.g. increase clock frequency for one or more half cycles, flipflops sample input before it's ready)
		- power supply
		- external electrical fields
- Most Smart Cards include hardware countermeasures against such attacks
	- Low/High voltage sensor
	- Frequency sensor and filters
	- Light sensor
	- Glitch sensor
	- Temperature sensor
	- Life test function for sensor
- Software countermeasures also used

### Crypto-Processors
- Basic Properties
	- hold secret keys
	- perform crypto operations
	- TPM functionality
	- access protected with master key
	- advanced tamper resistance
- Typical attacks
	- Cryptanalysis: exploit design flaws in crypto primitives
	- Protocol analysis
		- Protocol attack: flaws in protocol in which crypto primitives are used
		- API attack: extends protocol attacks/analysis to APIs

#### Protocol-level / API Attacks (example on Crypto-Processor)
- «Security API»
	- top-level software component of a cryptoprocessor
	- extends cryptographic API by enforcing *policy* on the interactions
- ... TODO ... Lecture 3 slides 35ff
- Such attacks computationally simple and fast
- Attacker needs access to devices or the network connecting them
- Countermeasures:
	- Access Control
	- Only enable what is required, disable access/functionality of everything else
- Physical security of device not important for this attack
- API analysis seems to be similar to analyzing authentication/key exchange protocols
