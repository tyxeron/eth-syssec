## Basics
- Stream Cipher: processes a message bit (byte) by bit (byte)
- Block Cipher: encrypt/decrypt blocks of a message
- Message Authentication Code (MAC)
	- Input: message, secret key
	- Output: authenticator of fixed length (the MAC)
	- Message Authentication: $(\operatorname{MAC} = C(k, m)$
	- Message Authentication & Confidentiality: $(\operatorname{Enc}(k_2, (m \, || \, C(k_1, m)))$)

## Block Ciphers
- Encrypt/Decrypt blocks of $(N$) bits
- Each block interpreted as a symbol of an alphabet of size $(2^N$)
- Converts such a symbol (i.e. a block) plaintext to a ciphertext symbol. $(2^N!$) such mappings exists
- Secret key used to select one of the mappings
- Ideal Block Cipher:
	- Use any of the $(2^N!$) possible mappings
	- Would require a secret of $(\log(2^N!)$) bits
	- Such secrets are infeasible (e.g. $(N = 64 \Rightarrow \, \approx 10^{11} \text{GB}$))

### Practical Block Ciphers
- Use $(K$) bits to select a random subset of $(2^K$) mappings
- Important selected mapping is **random**, then we get a good approximation of the ideal block cipher
- Use Shannon's confusion and diffusion principles:
	- Confusion: Each bit of the ciphertext should depend on the whole secret. If one bit changes in the key the entire ciphertext should change.
		- Use small Pseudorandom Permutations (PRPs) $(f_i(k, m_i)$) where $(f_i$) depends on the secret $(k$) and is often called a Substitution-Box (S-Box)
		- Each $(f_i$) returns $(b = |f_i|$) bits
		- Confusion done by $(F_k(m) = F_k(m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n) = f_1(k, m_1) f_2(k, m_2) \cdots f_n(k, m_n)$)
		- Because splitting the message $(m$) up and put each piece into one of the $(f_i$) we get only $(\leq b$) bits changed in $(F_k$) if one bit changes in $(m$)
	- Diffusion: ciphertext bits should depend on plaintext bits in complex way. If bit $(i$) changes in plaintext, bit $(j$) in ciphertext should change with probability $(p=\frac{1}{2}$).
		- Takes the output of $(F_k$) by re-odering the bits
		- Permutation can be independent of the secret
	- Implemented using Feistel Networks (e.g. in DES), Substitution-Permutation Networks (e.g. in AES)
	- Run Confusion and Diffusion multiple times (i.e. multiple rounds)
	- Overall security depends on the key schedule, S-Boxes and how the permutations are done
	- Use of avalanche effect
		- small changes to input impact whole output
		- S-Boxes designed in a way that one bit changing in the input results in at least two bits changed in the output of the S-Box
		- Permutations designed in a way that output of one S-Box is the input of multiple S-Boxes in the next round
